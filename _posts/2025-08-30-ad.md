When enumerating a system, it is important to note down any credentials. These may be found in configuration files (`.conf`, `.config`, `.xml`, etc.), shell scripts, a user's bash history file, backup (`.bak`) files, within database files or even in text files. Credentials may be useful for escalating to other users or even root, accessing databases and other systems within the environment.
